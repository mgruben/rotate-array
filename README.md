# rotate-array 
Given an array of n elements, rotate those elements to the right by k steps

For example, the array `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` is rotated to `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]` if `k = 3`.  

Also, the array `[1,2,3]` is rotated to `[3,1,2]` if `k = 2`.

This solution has O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

This project was completed for [LeetCode - Problem 189](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
